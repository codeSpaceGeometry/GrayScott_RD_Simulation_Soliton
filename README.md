# GrayScott_RD_Simulation_Soliton

This code is credited to Daniel Shiffman and his guide on how to create a Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion system in Javascript. I tweaked the color and shape to represent the soliton parameter space. RD systems not only mimic biological life such as cow hide and fish skin patterns, but also mimic chemical and quantum-mechanical patterns in nature.
